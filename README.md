## Date: 1/5/2024

### Written by: Jinan Zuhair



### ***a description***
#### The team leader must reveal the identity of the card once a member of his team touches it. If they guess correctly, they can continue playing until they decide to stop or choose the wrong card. The turn then goes to the opposing team with a clue to guess.
   The first team to contact all of their secret agents wins the game

### ***start***

##### The game begins with a leader guessing to choose the correct card.
Then the rest of the bosses guess which card is the correct card.

***
#####Wireframe
There will be a square in which there is one large card in the middle, closed, and next to it is a simple description of the card, and at the bottom there are many exposed cards. Every time you click on the card, it shows you whether the card you guessed is the correct card or not, and there is a time.

****
###Pseudocode
In the beginning, we create a framework that includes a process of calculating the time starting from zero to two minutes, a process for turning the cards over, and a process that compares the chosen card with the card that the player chose.
